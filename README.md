# 🤖 AI Virtual Assistant — JARVIS-Style MERN Application

AI Virtual Assistant is a full-stack MERN application that brings a **voice-enabled, intelligent assistant** to life.
Inspired by JARVIS, this assistant can **listen, think, speak, and remember users**, powered by **Gemini AI**, **Web Speech API**, and a secure backend.

The project demonstrates real-world AI integration, authentication, cloud storage, and full deployment.
